### Credit to my teammates!
Team members:

-Fahad
-Wei Hao
-Srija

<br/>
This search engine can only perform simple search based on certain keywords. 
>To try, go to GOOGOL.java file, run it and type "shop" into the search box.
<br/>
There are calculator and translator built into this search engine.
The part I coded is the logic behind calculator and tic-tac-toc.

Have Fun!
